Sliding Mode Control **(SMC)** is the most important nonlinear controller.<br>
In this code, I created a SMC to control a **quadrotor**. By this controller all 6_DOFs(Roll, Pitch, Yaw, X, Y, and Z) are controlled.<br>
Moreover, simulation results are in the last part of the code.<br>
This code is written by <strong>Python</strong>, also **Numpy** and **Matplotlib** are used.<br>
