Sliding Mode Control **(SMC)** is the most important nonlinear controller.<br>
In this code I created a SMC to control a **quadrotor**. By this controller all 6_DOFs(Roll, Pitch, Yaw, Z, X, Y) is controled.<br>
also, simulation resualts are in the last part of code.<br>
This code is written by <strong>Python</strong>,and Numpy, and Matplotlib are used.<br>
